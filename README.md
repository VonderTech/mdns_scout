# mDNS Scout - Discover Local Services

Welcome to mDNS Scout, a Flutter app designed to effortlessly scan your local network for services, allowing users to browse and inspect them with ease.

## What is mDNS?

mDNS, or Multicast DNS, is a protocol that empowers devices on a local network to discover and connect to each other without the need for a central server. This zero-configuration networking approach is also recognized as Bonjour (by Apple) or Avahi (used in Linux environments).

## Zero-Configuration Networking

Zero-conf networking simplifies the user experience by automating service discovery and resolution. In the context of mDNS Scout, it means the app seamlessly finds and connects to services on your local network.
